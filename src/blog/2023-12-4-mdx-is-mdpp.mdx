## Finding A New Place For Thoughts.

Writing down thoughts is only half the battle; the other is finding a place to put them.
Throughout the week, I've been taking note of any interesting ideas or problems I come across and write a short blurb about them.
Up until now, These notes have only existed in Obsidian, a Markdown, local-first notes application.

Wanting to find a new place to put these blurbs, I figured I might as well just write up a whole site dedicated to them.
The hardest question I had to answer was: **How will I write them?**

## Markdown: The Obvious Choice

Markdown is everywhere, simple, supported in many text editors and can easily be rendered on the web.
It's **the** standard choice for writing content in a plain-text format.

```md
# This is some content

> This is a quote

-   This is a list
-   This is a list
-   This is a list

## This is a subheading

This is some more content
```

It does have some limitations though. In its simplicity, it lacks custom components and is limited to the Markdown spec.
Lists, headings, links, images and some basic text formatting are all you get.
That covers most use-cases, but if you wanted to render an interactive graph, or provide a field to enter a value, you're out of luck.

### JSX: HTML in JavaScript

On the other end of the spectrum of simplicity vs flexibility is JSX. JSX is simply the format used by React to mimic HTML in JavaScript.
Importantly with JSX, you can easily write your own reusable components and React itself has a large ecosystem of support.

```tsx
function MyPage() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            <p>This is some content</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a list</li>
                <li>This is a list</li>
                <li>This is a list</li>
            </ul>
            <SomeCustomComponent args={1234} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

Writing in this format isn't as great as Markdown.
It's more verbose and requires a bit more knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.
Editors don't syntax highlight the code in the `<code>` elements.
Additionally trying to write a `<code>` block ends up having to be indented differently because despite being nested, it's not nested in the same way as the JSX.

### Writing Code in Markdown vs JSX

With JSX:

```tsx
function Component() {
    return (
        <div>
            <code>{`
const a = 4;
for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
`}</code>
        </div>
    );
}
```

With Markdown:

```
'''tsx
const a = 4;
for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
'''
```

## MDX: Markdown + JSX

Recently I came across MDX and was surprised to find it was exactly what I was looking for: **a hybrid of Markdown and JSX**.
It benefits from the simple writing style of Markdown, but allows custom components, including `@blueprintjs/core` components.

### Example

```md
## Example: Callout

As you can see this is otherwise normal Markdown.

<Callout intent="success" icon="airplane">
    <h5>MDX is Markdown with JSX</h5>
    <p>MDX is Markdown with JSX</p>
</Callout>

Within your Markdown, import a JSX component and use it.
```

### Result

<Card>
As you can see this is otherwise normal Markdown.

<Callout intent="success" icon="airplane">
    <h5>MDX is Markdown with JSX</h5>
    <p>MDX is Markdown with JSX</p>
</Callout>

Within your Markdown, import a JSX component and use it.

</Card>

## How to use MDX

Currently, I am using `@mdx-js/rollup` with `remark-frontmatter` to parse the metadata at the top of the MDX file.

## Pitfalls

I was wanting to create a custom component called `<PresentCode>...</PresentCode>` that would render any content I want with an option to expand out a code block.
This would have been helpful to show off some component's usage while also easily showing the exact code that generated it.
At this current time, I am not able to parse the MDX between the component tags before they are rendered.

In the case of a simple example

```tsx
<PresentCode>
    <Callout intent="success" icon="airplane">
        <h5>MDX is Markdown with JSX</h5>
        <p>MDX is Markdown with JSX</p>
    </Callout>
</PresentCode>
```

I was hoping to be able to make the component render both the `<Callout>` and the code that generated it:

<Card>

<Callout intent="success" icon="airplane">
    <h5>MDX is Markdown with JSX</h5>
    <p>MDX is Markdown with JSX</p>
</Callout>
```
<Callout intent="success" icon="airplane">
    <h5>MDX is Markdown with JSX</h5>
    <p>MDX is Markdown with JSX</p>
</Callout>
```
</Card>

Remark and Rehype are popular and powerful tools for parsing Markdown and HTML respectively, but I have not been able to fully investigate a solution.
Given the depth, I expect it is possible.

## Writing This In MDX & Future Plans

This post was written in MDX and is available on GitHub.
I hope to continue writing with MDX and I've found it to be a useful hybrid of the two formats.
Things I'd like to be able to support in the future:

-   Table of Contents
-   Graphing & Charting
-   and more!
