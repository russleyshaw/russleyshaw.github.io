## Finding A New Place For Thoughts.

Writing down thoughts is only half the battle; the other is finding a place to put them.
Throughout the week, I've been taking note of any interesting ideas or problems I come across and write a short blurb about them.
Wanting to find a new place to put these blurbs, I figured I might as well just write up a whole site dedicated to them.
The hardest question I had to answer was: **How will I write them?**

## Markdown: The Obvious Choice

Markdown is everywhere, simple, supported in many text editors and can easily be rendered on the web.
It's nearly the standard choice for writing content in a plain-text format. An example of Markdown might look like the following:

```md
# This is some content

> This is a quote

-   This is a list
-   This is a list
-   This is a list

## This is a subheading

This is some more content
```

However; in its simplicity, it lacks custom components and is limited to the Markdown spec:
lists, headings, links, images and some basic text formatting.
That covers most use-cases, but if you wanted to render an interactive graph, or provide a field to enter a value, you'll want a more flexible solution.

### JSX: HTML in JavaScript

On the other end of the spectrum of simplicity vs flexibility is JSX.
JSX is the format used by React to mimic HTML in JavaScript.
Importantly with JSX (or TSX, the TypeScript variant) you can easily write your own reusable components
If you've seen a React component, you've seen JSX/TSX:

```tsx
// MyPage.tsx
function MyPage() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            <p>This is some content</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a list</li>
                <li>This is a list</li>
                <li>This is a list</li>
            </ul>
            <SomeCustomComponent args={1234} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

We lose some of the simplicitly in Markdown, but gain the full flexibility of writing React applications.
It requires a bit more knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to use.
Additionally trying to write a `<code>` block behaves differently, it's not nested in the same way as Markdown and syntax highlighting isn't supported by default.

### Writing Code in Markdown vs JSX

With JSX:

```tsx
function Component() {
    return (
        <div>
            <code>{`
const a = 4;
for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
`}</code>
        </div>
    );
}
```

With Markdown:

```
'''tsx
const a = 4;
for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
'''
```

## MDX: Markdown + JSX

Recently I came across MDX and found mostly what I was looking for: **a hybrid of Markdown and JSX**.
It benefits from the simple writing style of Markdown, but allows custom components.

### Example

````md
## Example: Callout

As you can see this is otherwise normal Markdown.

## How to use MDX

Currently, I am using `@mdx-js/rollup` with `remark-frontmatter` to parse the metadata at the top of the MDX file.

To include it in your Vite React application, it only requires a small edit to your `vite.config.ts`.
Afterwards you'll be able to import `.mdx` files as if they were `.tsx` files.

```js
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        {
            enforce: "pre",
            ...mdx({
                remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter],
            }),
        },
        react(),
    ],
});
```
````

In my case, I lazily load the MDX files using React Suspense. This allows the content of the page to be loaded only when requested.

```tsx
const MyPostLazy = lazy(() => import("./2023-12-4-mdx-is-mdpp.mdx"));

// ...

return (
    <Suspense fallback={"Loading..."}>
        <MyPostLazy />
    </Suspense>
);
```

## Pitfalls

I was wanting to create a custom component called `<PresentCode>...</PresentCode>` that would render any content I want with an option to expand out a code block.
This would have been helpful to show off some component's usage while also easily showing the exact code that generated it.
At this current time, I am not able to parse the MDX between the component tags before they are rendered.

Remark and Rehype are popular and powerful tools for parsing Markdown and HTML respectively, but I have not been able to fully investigate a solution.
Given the depth, I expect it is possible and an improvement for the future.
