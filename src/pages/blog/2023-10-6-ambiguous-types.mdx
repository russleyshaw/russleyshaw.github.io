Many coming from dynamic languages are worried about their development being slowed by needing to explicitly declare types everywhere.
However, **TypeScript is smart enough to infer types in many cases.** We want it to work for us as hard as possible so we can do less with more.

```ts
function getTime() {
    return Date.now();
}

const bornAt: string = getNumber();
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

Here, we can see the inferencing of `getTime`'s return type is `number`, which keeps us from assigning it to a `string` variable.
TypeScript a powerful inferencing ability; **however, it occasionally doesn't infer what we'd like**.

## Where TypeScript Inference Fails

A common operation performed is filtering out `null` and `undefined` values from an array. Typically, this might be done like so:

```ts
const arr = [0, 1, 2, null, "foo", undefined, 3, 4, 5];

const result = arr.filter(v => v != null);
```

However, the type of `result` is `(string | number | null | undefined)[]`. Given all the context provided,
it is impossible for null or undefined to exist in this array. What we really want
is the result to be `(string | number)[]`. Typescript is not smart enough to infer that the
only possible results from the filter are non-nullable.

## Helping TypeScript Infer Types

A way we can help it infer the types through the `filter` is by defining a `type assertion` function.

```ts
// Assert value is T if not null nor undefined
function isNotNil<T>(value: T | null | undefined): value is T {
    return value != null;
}
```

In the example above, we can recontextualize the `v != null` operation
into a function called `isNotNil` that forces/asserts the types
appropriately.

```ts
const out1 = arr.filter(v => v != null);
// out1: (string | number | null | undefined)[]
// [0, 1, 2, "foo", 3, 4, 5]

const out2 = arr.filter(isNotNil);
// out2: (string | number)[]
// [0, 1, 2, "foo", 3, 4, 5]
```

Now, we have a function that more explicitly declares the intended type lost by
TypeScript, but also it has a more meaningful name.
