TypeScript treats array indexes as always defined. Same with destructuring. One
issue encountered in Partcaster was we were expecting a first element and captured
the rest in a seperate value
            
```ts
const [first, ...rest] = values;
```
However, in this case values was `[]` so first was undefined and rest was `[]`. To prevent this, write a simple `getHeadTail()` function that treats the first element as undefined.
```ts
function getHeadTail<T>(items: T[]): [T | undefined, T[]] {
    const [first, ...rest] = items;
    return [first, rest];
}

const [first, rest] = getHeadTail([1, 2, 3]);
console.log(first, rest); // 1, [2, 3]
```
            
Or consider using `arr.at(number)` which treats its return result as `T | undefined`. It accepts
negative values so you can do `arr.at(-1)` to get the last element or `arr.at(0)` to get the
first element.
